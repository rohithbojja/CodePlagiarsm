## Getting Started

### 1. Organize Your Files

Before running the Plagiarism Checker, make sure you have two specific folders set up:

- **Test Files**: Place the files you want to check for plagiarism in the `test_files` folder. This is where the tool will look for the documents you want to compare.

- **Uploaded Files**: Put the documents you want to compare the test files with in the `uploaded_files` folder. These are the documents that will be used as reference.

### 2. Install Dependencies (if not already installed)

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure you have the required dependencies. If you haven't already, you can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the Plagiarism Checker repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plagiarism-checker.git
cd plagiarism-checker
```

## Running the Plagiarism Checker

Now that your files are organized and the dependencies are installed, you can run the Plagiarism Checker.

### 1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

### 2. Navigate to the Plagiarism Checker Directory

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you have cloned the Plagiarism Checker repository:

```bash
cd path/to/plagiarism-checker
```

### 3. Run the Plagiarism Checker

Use the following command to run the Plagiarism Checker:

```bash
python plagiarism.py
```

The Plagiarism Checker will compare the files in the `test_files` folder with the files in the `uploaded_files` folder and generate a report.

## Viewing the Report

Once the Plagiarism Checker has finished running, it will generate a report in HTML format. Follow these steps to view the report:

### 1. Locate the Report

The report file, named `report.html`, will be generated in the same directory where the Plagiarism Checker script is located.

### 2. Open the Report in a Browser

To view the report, open your preferred web browser and navigate to the location of the `report.html` file.

You will see the Plagiarism Checker report, which will display the results of the comparison between the files in the `test_files` and `uploaded_files` folders.

Congratulations! You have successfully run the Plagiarism Checker and viewed the report. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or seek assistance from the tool's maintainers.
